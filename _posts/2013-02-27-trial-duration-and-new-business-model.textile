Hi everyone, we are fine-tuning our "SublimeVideo":http://sublimevideo.net service every day and we just decided to move from 30 to 7-days free trial duration, effective today. We would like to explain why we think this makes more sense, especially with our new add-ons-based business model.

Along the launch of our "SublimeVideo Horizon":http://sublimevideo.net/horizon-framework player framework 2 months ago, we also actually made a substantial switch to our business model:
* Our previous model was a freemium bundle-based model with monthly or yearly subscriptions. We were *charging you in advance* the amount corresponding to the bundle and duration you chose.
* With our new model, and because our player has now become fully modular (yeah, we'll never stop repeating how great this is), we decided to switch to a daily metered usage model of the add-ons you use and to *charge your total usage at the end of each month*. This is similar to what companies like Heroku are doing and we always liked their approach: great freemium and flexible paid features store.

The new add-ons metered model is really customers friendly: You assemble your player by shopping for the features you want and only pay for what you really need. Moreover you can activate or deactivate add-ons freely on a daily basis: There's *no rigid bundles anymore, which always contain a mix of useful and useless features*, your player's features set is exactly as you want it.

With the previous pre-paid bundle approach, it made business sense to offer our customers a single 30-days free trial but with the fluid add-on based approach billed post-usage, 30 days is not necessary, especially as this *is no longer a single free trial but several free-trials which we offer you, on each paid add-on, separately*. For this reason we believe *the sweet spot is to have a week* to test an add-on.

All the paid add-ons you activate from today will have a 7-day free trial and any paid add-ons you activated previously will of course complete their previous 30-days duration.
