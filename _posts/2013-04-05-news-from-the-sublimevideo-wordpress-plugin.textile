h3. Better YouTube integration

The latest major release (1.8.0) adds the YouTube integration right into the visual editor! Even though the YouTube integration was possible since the version 1.5.0 through a "shortcode setting":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/wordpress#shortcodes-attributes, the plugin was missing the nice UI touch that's already present in our "Video Publishing Assistant":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/video-publishing-assistant.

h3. Open-sourcing the plugin

Today, we are also very excited to open-source the "WordPress plugin on GitHub":https://github.com/jilion/sublimevideo-wordpress. We strongly believe in open-source projects and we think this will allow our users to directly propose new features and bug fixes right from the "project's issues tracker":https://github.com/jilion/sublimevideo-wordpress/issues!

We hope you enjoy our SublimeVideo WordPress plugin, and if you do, please give it a good rating/review in the "WordPress plugins directory":http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/sublimevideo-official.

If you have any comments or feedback, please let us know in our community forum [note: create the thread in the forum) or directly in the "GitHub project's issues tracker":https://github.com/jilion/sublimevideo-wordpress/issues.
