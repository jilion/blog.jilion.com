i-Cast 2.0 Replica - "http://icast2.brax.se":http://icast2.brax.se

Tetra Pak developed an internal video publishing and distribution platform called i-Cast to improve the accessibility and sharing of digital video within the company. Today, the highly scalable platform serves well over 1,000 videos over the company’s intranet, and can be accessed from over 200 local offices in 150 countries worldwide. The developers chose to implement SublimeVideo Player to handle playback of all of their video content. The replica system currently available online contains far less video content, but is otherwise identical.

We wanted something that was high impact. The choice was dead easy: we love the SublimeVideo player.”</p></blockquote>
