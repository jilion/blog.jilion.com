"Aelios 2":http://aeliosapp.com is the *first Weather App to support multiple weather providers* by allowing its users to choose their preferred provider!

Alongside multi-provider support, we’re thrilled to offer *data from AccuWeather* - one of the world's leading and most respected weather forecasters. We think our North american users will be particularly pleased!

With Aelios 1 we wanted to innovate in the Weather category by providing a completely new way to obtain weather forecasts. With version 2, Aelios’ unique user experience is decoupled from its data sources. *We believe users should have the choice* to use the weather data provider that serves them best!

We completely re-designed the info pane around our new multi-provider system, allowing users to arrange weather providers in order of preference.

We aim to bring more data providers in future updates. Please contact us if you have any suggestions of providers you’d like to see in Aelios.

We're also working on some great new features for the near future, including a pretty useful (and slick) favorites system that should be available in a few weeks. Thank you for your patience, we know a lot of you are really looking forward to this feature and we’re sure you’ll love what we’ve come up with!
