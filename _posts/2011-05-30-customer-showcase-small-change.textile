Small Change - "http://www.smallchangeshort.com":http://www.smallchangeshort.com

_Small Change_ is an independent short film that tells the story of how a young, single mother’s desperate hope for a big win on the slot machines causes her world to spiral out of control. The film received a lot of attention from such film festivals as Galway and Sundance, and CherryRed Pictures knew they needed an impressive site to help promote the film. They implemented SublimeVideo Player to give viewers the best possible viewing experience when watching the film’s trailer.

After years of using Flash for video I wanted to get away from it and allow iOS and other mobile devices to be able to watch it natively. The trailer was the most important part of the site so I spent a lot of time looking into HTML5 video but was aware we needed to make sure older browsers had a Flash fallback. I had tried a few solutions but nothing wrapped it all up so nicely like the Sublime service. When I showed Cathy a demo she loved the interface and the zoom/full screen options. I had already signed up for the beta earlier and incidentally I got my invite just few days after deciding it was the service for us.</p><p>Our visitors have noted on the player and how well it matches the look of the site and it's ease of use. For us it meant when we were out and about we could show people our trailer with our iPhones on the spot and at the same time showing off the rest of the site.”</p></blockquote>
