Participants watch a video of their favourite car and answer a question for the chance to win.

Digital agency "Flash Point Communications":http://www.flashpointcommunications.com/ chose SublimeVideo to power all of the site’s videos.

We previously saw Nissan embrace both HTML5 and SublimeVideo in their "Zen to Z web campaign":http://blog.jilion.com/2011/11/24/nissan-s-zen-to-z-web-campaign-powered-by-html5-and-sublimevideo. Video is a powerful and engaging tool, and we’re keen to see how other large and respected brands who’ve traditionally used Flash for their online campaigns choose to take advantage of HTML5 Video.
