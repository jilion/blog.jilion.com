Weâ€™d like to wish everyone happy holidays and end 2011 nicely by releasing the most requested addition to Aelios: A way to store your favorite locations. This may sound like a basic feature, but we took the time to think about a good way to implement it.

<a href="http://aeliosapp.com"><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2011/12/aelios_favorites.jpg" alt="Aelios Favorites" /></a>

We decided to use a photographic metaphor: We let you frame your favorite locations on Google Maps and take a snapshot to create your own Weather Posters by pressing the new camera button.

You can recall them from the search screen at any time and can easily reorder, delete or rename them.

Aelios 2.1 with _Weather Posters_ is available now "on the App Store":http://aeliosapp.com/appstore.
