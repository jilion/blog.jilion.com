As you guys probably saw, last month we released the "SublimeVideo Horizon Framework":http://sublimevideo.net/horizon-framework as well as our new "SublimeVideo Modular Player":http://sublimevideo.net/modular-player that has been entirely rewritten with SublimeVideo Horizon's technology.

Thanks to the new architecture, we are now able to build rock-solid, cross-platform new features very easily.

Today we are thrilled to announce the availability of the new ""Social Sharing Add-on!":http://sublimevideo.net/modular-player#social_sharing"

Social sharing buttons are one of the "most requested features":https://getsatisfaction.com/sublimevideo/ideas/popular. With the new add-on, you can provide your users with the ability to share your videos on popular social networks, such as Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Pinterest, directly from the player. Now, when your video is embedded on an external site, people can share it without having to go back to your site. It's even more flexible thanks to an option that allows you to display a direct link to the video page so your audience can share the video wherever they want (by email for instance). And of course, this add-on works everywhere, including on the latest mobile platforms.

"It's available now":http://sublimevideo.net/pricing and we are offering a 30-day free trial, like all our paid add-ons.

Last but not least, sharing a video is sometimes less straightforward than sharing just a page, so we created the extra step for you to be able to share a specific video within a page containing several videos! We really encourage you to "read our documentation":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/beta/addons/sharing to properly configure this add-on with your video elements in order to make the best of it.

We hope you like this new add-on and we are really looking forward to hearing "your feedback":https://getsatisfaction.com/sublimevideo/topics/comments_suggestions_for_the_social_sharing_add_on on additional social networks or options you would like to see.

Stay tuned for more add-ons coming soon!
