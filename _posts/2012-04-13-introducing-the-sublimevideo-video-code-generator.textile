Many of the integration issues our users run into can be avoided if their &lt;video&gt; elements are properly formatted and configured. We designed the Video Code Generator to streamline this process, and are pleased to announce that it is available now to all SublimeVideo users directly from their 'My Sites' page.

We've also created a "public version":https://my.sublimevideo.net/video-code-generator of the Code Generator, so that *anybody can quickly and easily test SublimeVideo Player with their own video assets*.

_Please note that the Video Code Generator requires a modern browser that supports HTML5. We recommend using the latest version of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera or IE9._

h4. Using the Video Code Generator

To use the Code Generator, simply select the type of player implementation you need (Standard, Lightbox or Iframe Embed) and enter the URLs of your video assets. The live preview shows you exactly how your video will look in SublimeVideo Player. 

Existing users just need to copy the generated code and paste it into the page(s) on their site where they want to add video. Non-registered users who like what they see can quickly "sign up":http://sublimevideo.net/plans for one of our free or paid plans and add SublimeVideo to their site in minutes.

h4. Under the hood

SublimeVideo’s Video Code Generator includes some powerful features to assist users in resolving common problems they may face when creating their own &lt;video&gt; elements:

h4. 1. Incorrectly configured MIME Types

If a source is hosted and served with the incorrect MIME Type, the video simply won’t play. 

The Video Code Generator automatically detects the video source’s MIME Type and informs the user if their Web server needs to be reconfigured. 

h4. 2. Incorrectly configured &lt;video&gt; elements

A common example of a &lt;video&gt; element being configured incorrectly would be when its width or height values don’t retain the source’s aspect ratio, resulting in a letterboxed/pillarboxed player (black bars around the video).

The Video Code Generator detects the original size and aspect ratio of the source file(s) and automatically provides the user with correctly proportioned width and height values. It also fixes other common configuration issues such as incorrect ordering of the &lt; source&gt; elements.

h4. 3. Malformed &lt;video&gt; code

It’s common to see the &lt;video&gt; code formatted incorrectly. For example, being split across multiple lines or missing small elements of the code itself.

The Video Code Generator always generates properly formatted &lt;video&gt; elements, so our users no longer have to worry about formatting details.

h4. Optimized for SublimeVideo

We hope this feature will make it even easier for people to enable HTML5 Video on their sites with SublimeVideo. Let us know what you think in the comments or on the "SublimeVideo Community Forum":http://getsatisfaction.com/sublimevideo.
