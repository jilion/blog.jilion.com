Well, we actually have one more thing in store for you before the end of the month!

A lot of "you asked for cue points":https://getsatisfaction.com/sublimevideo/topics/_upcoming_feature_cuepoints_comments_suggestions support. Today we are pleased to introduce our new "Cue Zones add-on":http://sublimevideo.net/modular-player#cue_zones, which allows to handle cue points in a more powerful way.

A cue point is a user defined "marker" at a specific time in the video when a custom event is designed to occur: you can perform a JavaScript action once the playback reaches that point of the video. The Cue Zones add-on allows you to define not only a starting but also an ending point - hence "zones" - in your video where those custom actions should start and end occurring. 

This add-on opens the door for tons of possible applications, such as:

* Your video presents a product? Now you can display purchase links, images or any other additional info about the product around the video.
* Your video is showing a person speaking at a conference? Now you can synchronize the presentation slides next to the video.
* You can use Cue Zones to create chapters in your video.
* You could also use this add-on to dynamically display ad banners directly related to the content currently viewed by your audience.

These are just some simple examples of how you can use the Cue Zones add-on but the possibilities are infinite! We are sure many of you already have a lot of cool ideas on how to use it and we look forward to seeing what you'll create with it. We invite you to "read the documentation":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/beta/addons/cue-zones to learn more and see some examples.

"Itâ€™s now available":http://sublimevideo.net/pricing with a 7-day free trial, just like all our paid add-ons.

We are happy to end February with 3 new add-ons and we look forward to releasing new features in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!
