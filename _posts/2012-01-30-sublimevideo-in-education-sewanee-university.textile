At the time, we were in the process of redeveloping our homepage (using HTML5), and SublimeVideo felt like great timing for our video player needs.</p><p>Some may question “why use a paid solution to deliver HTML5 video when there are many free alternatives available?” With SublimeVideo the answer is straightforward: a wonderful interface, responsive support, and ease of use both for us and our users. The peace of mind SublimeVideo brings us is why we were happy to be a paid customer.”</p></blockquote>
