After some more thoughts, we came to the conclusion that developers shouldn't have to pay for API methods! In fact, the Player API is a core feature that should allow any developer to create a great integration for SublimeVideo in their website.

That's why today we're really excited to add 5 new methods to the "SublimeVideo Player API":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/javascript-api/player:
* "@seekTo()@":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/javascript-api/player#seekTo
* "@duration()@":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/javascript-api/player#duration
* "@playbackTime()@":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/javascript-api/player#playbackTime
* "@videoWidth()@":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/javascript-api/player#videoWidth
* "@videoHeight()@":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/javascript-api/player#videoHeight

We're also adding 3 new events:
* "@seek@":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/javascript-api/player#event-seek
* "@metadata@":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/javascript-api/player#event-metadata
* "@timeUpdate@":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/javascript-api/player#event-timeupdate

These new methods and events are included in the SublimeVideo Player's core features and *immediately available to use for free*. Please give us your feedback "in our community forum":https://getsatisfaction.com/sublimevideo/topics/_upcoming_feature_advanced_player_api_comments_suggestions.
