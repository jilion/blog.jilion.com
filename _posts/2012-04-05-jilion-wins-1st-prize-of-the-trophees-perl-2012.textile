It’s been an incredible week for us, first with SublimeVideo being awarded both the "MIPCube Lab Jury Prize":http://blog.jilion.com/2012/04/02/sublimevideo-awarded-most-promising-disruptive-tv-start-up-at-mipcube-lab-2012 and "Vivendi’s “Coup de coeur” Prize":http://blog.jilion.com/2012/04/03/vivendi-awards-sublimevideo-its-coup-de-coeur-prize-at-mipcube-lab-2012 at MIPCube 2012 over the weekend. 

We promise this is pure coincidence and we aren’t trying to show off, but we’ve just won another award!

Yesterday evening, the Jilion team attended the Awards Ceremony for the “Trophées PERL 2012 Entrepreneurship Prize for the Lausanne Region”. We are very happy to be able to announce that *Jilion won 1st Prize*!

The Trophées PERL Prize is held annually to discover companies working on the four most innovative projects in the region of our home town. The 2012 ceremony was especially significant as it marked the competition’s tenth year; in the last decade over 200 companies competed, with 36 winners being awarded a total of $1 million to help continue developing their projects.

We’d like to thank the District association of Lausanne and the jury:
