Car manufacturers have traditionally relied heavily on Flash to implement and deliver big web campaigns such as this. Nissan’s new campaign is *built entirely with HTML5* and makes significant use of video.

*We’re thrilled they decided to rely on "SublimeVideo":http://sublimevideo.net to deliver their video message*. The campaign is live now with new video episodes being revealed every week. It’s always great to see companies such as Nissan taking advantage of the latest web technologies for important product launches.
