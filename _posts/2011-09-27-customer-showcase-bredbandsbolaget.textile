The SublimeVideo Player has helped us to showcase the latest and upcoming TV-shows. Thanks to the support offered by SublimeVideo, the implementation into our CMS was made simple.</p><p>Our editors can quickly add a video player as part of the website or as a lightbox. We love the fact that the player automatically chose the best format for each visitor and that it works in all browsers.”</p></blockquote>
