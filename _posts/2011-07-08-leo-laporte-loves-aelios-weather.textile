Aelios was just featured on "Leo Laporte":http://leoville.com and ["Sarah Lane":http://www.sarahlane.com]'s podcast ""iPad Today 52":http://twit.tv/ipt52: Weather App Extravaganza"!

There's one funny thing about it that we really want to share with you:
You might have noticed that Leo always has a large LCD clock behind him. The truth is that this particular clock actually provided us with the spark of inspiration to design Aelios’ “Weather Poster” mode!

Indeed, during the design phase we routinely said to one another “We need to design a beautiful weather forecast view, something that could be used like Leo’s big clock; something that he would love himself”.

Last week this story came full circle; Leo and Sarah gave Aelios a rave review, all without ever speaking to us. Isn’t that cool ? :-)

The Team would like to give a warm thank you to Sarah and Leo for their kind words and this unintentional connection.
