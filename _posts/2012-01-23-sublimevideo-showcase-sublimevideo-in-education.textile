Rogerson - Sewanee" class="no_rounded" style="float:left;margin:7px 22px 0 0" /> “When we first came across SublimeVideo we were really impressed by how beautiful the player looked. At the time, we were in the process of redeveloping our homepage (using HTML5), and SublimeVideo felt like great timing for our video player needs.</p><p>Some may question “why use a paid solution to deliver HTML5 video when there are many free alternatives available?” With SublimeVideo the answer is straightforward: a wonderful interface, responsive support, and ease of use both for us and our users. The peace of mind SublimeVideo brings us is why we were happy to be a paid customer.”</p></blockquote>

When we ran into problems with video encoding, the folks at SublimeVideo walked us through solving the issues step-by-step even though the problem was not with their servers, but with our conversion software.”</p></blockquote>

h4. Ferdinand Center for the Creative (The Philippines)

<a href="http://www.ferdinandcc.org" title="Visit ferdinandcc.org"><img src="http://blog.jilion.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/01/ferdinand_cc_sublimevideo.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo on Ferdinand Center for the Creative" /></a>
Ferdinand Center for the Creative - "http://www.ferdinandcc.org":http://www.ferdinandcc.org

Ferdinand Center for the Creative is a nonprofit in the Philippines working to help young artists become accomplished graphic designers, get great jobs, and escape poverty.

<blockquote><p><img src="http://blog.jilion.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/01/lester_nelson_ferdinand_cc.jpg" alt="Lester Nelson - Ferdinand Center for the Creative" class="no_rounded" style="float:left;margin:7px 22px 0 0" /> “Ferdinand Center for the Creative is a progressive organization, and when it came to posting videos, I wanted us to support HTML5 first and foremost, with Flash as a fallback, not the other way round. At the same time, I knew that a large segment of our audience views our site from older, outdated PCs at internet cafes around the Philippines, so we needed to be compatible with a large assortment of browsers.</p><p>Any video player we chose needed to be elegant, and as un-branded as possible, to let our own brand shine. I’m a very details-oriented graphic designer, but I’m no coder, so it needed to be simple to implement and not require problem-solving on my part. I’m happy to say that SublimeVideo has a gorgeous, but non-disruptive user interface, and was a piece of cake to get set up and running. And when I had server-side caching problems completely unrelated to SublimeVideo, your wonderful tech support even helped me get that solved too!”</p></blockquote>
