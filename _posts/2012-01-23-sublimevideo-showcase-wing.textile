Wing - "http://www.wing.tv":http://www.wing.tv

Wing is a London-based creative visual agency specializing in delivering innovative, targeted campaigns. Wing have created ads, promotional videos and other short form content for such leading brands as Coca Cola, Adidas, Lotus, McLaren and Hugo Boss.

UK-based digital agency "Slipstream":http://www.slipstreamstudio.com developed Wing's video-driven site, and chose SublimeVideo to power their video portfolio. Using SublimeVideo API ("resize method":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/javascript-api/methods#resize), Slipstream implemented a custom 'Cinema Mode' to instantly enlarge any video on the Wing site.

Slipstream developed a custom video management and encoding platform for Wing, and really needed a player that we could integrate as quickly as possible. Wing also needed to be able to present the results of their campaigns to their clients, so finding a video player with integrated statistics was vital.</p><p>In SublimeVideo we found everything we needed and more, and come back to it as our player of choice for every project.”</p></blockquote>
