Camera + (Clarity) - "http://campl.us/clarity":http://campl.us/clarity

Renowned iPhone developers tap tap tap have worked alongside professional photographer and web personality Lisa Bettany to develop Camera+, the ultimate photo app for iPhone. They created a short, sweet promo video showing off the app’s latest killer feature - Clarity. Clarity automatically analyzes photos and makes intelligent adjustments to really make a user’s photos pop. Of course, tap tap tap needed a great player to show off their new video, and we’re thrilled that they chose SublimeVideo. Check it out now to find out more about Clarity.

The fact that SublimeVideo makes it so we can just drop in a line of Javascript and it works consistently across all the browsers is amazing. The great design and thoughtful user experience just make it even better.”</p></blockquote>
