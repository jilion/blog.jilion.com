We don't yet live in a world where every visitor can view MP4 videos natively, so we needed a solution that degraded gracefully back to Flash-wrapped videos for people using older browsers.</p><p>We looked at several offerings, but only SublimeVideo combined great aesthetics with an easy to use (and easy to implement) product. Being able to quickly and easily see how many videos had been served was a great bonus, too. Jillion were very quick to respond to our initial questions and their obvious commitment to making a cool, seamless product impressed us. Since our new site went live, we've been extremely happy with SublimeVideo. Nice work guys!”</p></blockquote>
