Method & Craft - "http://methodandcraft.com":http://methodandcraft.com

Launched in February 2011, Method & Craft boasts a rich collection of articles, interviews, notes and videos focusing on the process of design and those who practice it. The team behind Method & Craft have done a great job at designing a beautiful site that also makes it easy to find and read any of their articles, interviews and notes on design. Presenting their rapidly growing collection of videos as beautifully as their text-based content was a different challenge, and we are thrilled that they turned to SublimeVideo Player to achieve just that. If you are a designer or creative of any kind who hasn’t already done so, we’d strongly recommend checking out Method & Craft.

The SublimeVideo player not only delivered on that need in spades, but also looks absolutely gorgeous which is a big deal to design nerds like us."
