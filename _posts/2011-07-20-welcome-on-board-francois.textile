What most young companies are missing is the support of real mentors: Experienced, successful, passionate and generous individuals willing to invest money and a significant share of their time to help a start-up get off the ground. François Stieger is one of these rare individuals.

We are very happy to announce that François is investing in Jilion, where he will also be joining the Board of Directors.

During his international career, François has worked as CEO of Intentional Software International, Senior Vice-President of Verisign and Vice-President of Oracle and Broadvision where he was actively involved in the latter’s successful IPO on the Nasdaq and Neuer Markt. François was also a Venture Partner at Amadeus Capital in London.

bq. "I am very excited by the wonderful technology developed by Jilion and look forward to helping the team turn this company into a worldwide success" François said.

Welcome on board François!
