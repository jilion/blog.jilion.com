Today we are going a step further with the brand new "Auto Embed add-on":http://sublimevideo.net/modular-player#embed!

The free Embed add-on allows your audience to easily share your videos by embedding them into their own sites or elsewhere on the web. However, *like any other manual embed solution, this requires you to create a "special" HTML page and keep it in sync* with the video you want to make embeddable. Let's be honest, that's *an annoying and repetitive task*! 

Thanks to our new Auto Embed add-on and the power of SublimeVideo's Cloud architecture, *this is now a thing of the past!* The new Auto Embed add-on *takes care of everything and manages all your embed files automatically* so you don't have to code or keep anything in sync. Please learn more "in our documentation":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/addons/embed.

The Auto Embed add-on is "now available":http://sublimevideo.net/pricing with a 7-day free trial, just like all our paid add-ons. We hope you'll like it and we're really looking forward to hearing your feedback.
