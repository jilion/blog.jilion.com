Today we're announcing a major update to SublimeVideo:

h4. New, Free and Unlimited SublimeVideo HTML5 Video Player

We're thrilled to introduce a new, free and unlimited version of "SublimeVideo":http://sublimevideo.net.

After the commercial launch of SublimeVideo earlier this year, and alongside today’s introduction of great, cloud-powered new features, we’re ready to *shift gear and introduce something radical* that we’ve wanted to do for a while: *Give anyone a free, traffic unlimited, no-compromise* version of SublimeVideo Player.

h4. Contributing to the web’s transition to HTML5 Video

We started SublimeVideo last year because *we wanted to turn the promises of HTML5 Video into a reality* - to make web video simpler and more enjoyable for everybody.

Adobe's recent decision to stop development of Mobile Flash and fully embrace HTML5 is *a clear signal that HTML5 is now mandatory for all sites*.

SublimeVideo already provides any website with a fast, reliable and pain-free way to migrate from Flash to HTML5 Video. The new, free plan now makes *it accessible to anyone*. We’re really happy to be able to do this; we see it as *our contribution to a better and more modern Web*.

h4. Enhanced Paid Plans

In addition to our new free plan, we’re also introducing *enhanced paid plans* with amazing *new Real-Time Stats* (more details below) and *far larger monthly viewing allowances*!

Not only do we now give you many more views, but we've also switched the metric used to measure your player views from _Video Pageviews_ (counted every time the page containing your video loads) to _Video Plays_ (counted only when playback of your video starts). 

The new _Plus_ plan is available for $9.90 per site/month and $99 per site/year, and replaces the _Comet_ plan. The new _Premium_ plan is available for $49.90 per site/month and $499 per site/year, and replaces the _Planet_, _Star_ and _Galaxy_ Plans.

*Existing customers: Don't worry!* Your plans have automatically been upgraded to our new, enhanced offerings. Visit "this page":https://docs.sublimevideo.net/plan-migration for more details on how you've been updated.

h4. Universal, Real-Time Stats

<img src="http://blog.jilion.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/11/sublimevideo_stats.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo Real-Time Stats" style="float:left;margin:8px 26px 5px 0" />Today, we're also introducing a great new feature to our paid plans: Universal, Real-Time Statistics for any platform!

We think our new stats platform is quite unique: As far as we know it’s the world’s first to offer a truly *comprehensive, real-time picture* of your site's video traffic, *whether generated from mobile or desktop, HTML5 or Flash*.

Our Real-Time Statistics platform leverages the power of SublimeVideo’s cloud-based technology and *lays the foundations for even more great new features to come*. Please let us know what you think and what you’d like to see next in our new "Community Forum":http://getsatisfaction.com/sublimevideo.

Users of our new, free plan also have access to stats for the past 24 hours, and can easily upgrade to our paid plans offering real-time stats and longer data retention (with yearly or unlimited stats storage).

h4. HD Switching, Video Embeds and Community Forum

We’ve also added two important features to our player, which we ensured work perfectly in HTML5: HD Switching and Video Embeds.

To the end user it may just look like an ordinary HD switch, *but we took great care to implement it properly* so that it *fully complies with the HTML5 standard*.

<img src="http://blog.jilion.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2011/11/sublimevideo_embed.png" alt="SublimeVideo Embed" style="float:left;margin:14px 16px 2px 0" />The addition of our free plan and larger monthly viewing allowances to our paid plans means that we can now offer SublimeVideo embeds, allowing your audience to easily embed your videos into their own sites or around the web.

Read more about the new player features on our "Features page":http://sublimevideo.net/features.

Last but not least, we're launching a new "Community Forum":http://getsatisfaction.com/sublimevideo on GetSatisfaction which you can use to report bugs, share your ideas and ask us questions. "Sign up for SublimeVideo":http://sublimevideo.net to join the community today and let us know what you’d like to see next!

We hope you’ll enjoy the new SublimeVideo as much as we do! *A big thank you to our customers for their continued support* ...and welcome to our new users!
