After trying out numerous other (free) alternatives I'd always come across a random bug or browser issue that meant they couldn't be used in a production environment — then along came Sublime, and just worked flawlessly first time. When time is precious, sometimes it's best to just spend a little to save a lot — and this is one of those times!”</p></blockquote>
