Last Friday, we released our "Social Sharing Add-on":http://blog.jilion.com/2013/02/01/introducing-sublimevideo-social-sharing-add-on. Today we are pleased to release our brand new "Embed Add-on":http://sublimevideo.net/modular-player#embed. This Add-on will be free for all our users.

Many are already providing an option allowing to embed SublimeVideo players, but until today the only way to do that was to manually provide a code outside the player, which is not exactly straightforward. Plus, as soon as the video was embedded somewhere it was in most cases impossible to re-embed it again, drastically limiting the sharing range of the video.

Today we've solved this issue by releasing our new free Embed Add-on, which will provide you an in-player embed button which will stick to your video wherever it is embedded. Moreover, we added an option for your users to choose a custom size before embedding the video. The only thing you have to provide is a url on your HTML page that will be used for the embed iframe, learn more about this "in our documentation":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/beta/addons/embed.

And of course, thanks to our powerful and unique cross-platform support, this Add-on works everywhere, including the latest mobile platforms!

You can begin using the "new free Embed Add-on now":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/beta/addons/embed. We hope you like it and we are really looking forward to "hearing your feedback":https://getsatisfaction.com/sublimevideo.

As explained in previous posts, our new SublimeVideo Horizon player framework allows us to deliver new features much faster than before, so stay tuned for more add-ons coming soon!
