With SublimeVideo subtitles you are not only providing a great experience to your hearing-impaired audience, but you're also increasing your videos' global reach: SublimeVideo supports *multi-language subtitles* on all desktop browsers and the latest mobile platforms.

Our subtitles implementation is based on the "HTML5 @<track>@ element":http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-video-element.html#the-track-element specification but we added an extra feature that might be useful for a lot of people. In fact the @<track>@ element doesn't allow to host subtitles files on another domain other than the site's domain. In some cases it's fine but when you want to have all your assets on a CDN it can be an issue. SublimeVideo goes further by providing the ability to host your subtitles files wherever you want using "CORS":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing.

It's now available *to everyone for free*.

Please "check out the documentation":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/subtitles for more info on how to add subtitles to your videos. We hope you’ll like this feature and we’re really looking forward to "hearing your feedback":https://getsatisfaction.com/sublimevideo/topics/_upcoming_feature_subtitles_comments_suggestions.
