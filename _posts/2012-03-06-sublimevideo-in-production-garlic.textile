Garlic is a video production company in Madrid, Spain. They specialize in shooting live-action material, and have worked with brands such as Coca Cola, Sony, Mitsubishi and The World Wildlife Foundation.

Garlic’s site was built by graphic and web design agency "Pixel Studios":http://www.pixelstudios.es.

After hours of testing and comparing the top solutions, we finally chose SublimeVideo Player for a variety of reasons. Specifically, the perfect cross-browser/platform compatibility and beautiful look and feel.”</p></blockquote>
