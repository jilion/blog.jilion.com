This is simply *the most important series of announcements we ever made*!

More details will be posted in the coming days, but here’s a taste of what's on our menu!
*Are you ready? Fasten your seat belt!*

First things first, how about *a revolution in HTML5 Video?*
What if we could *remove all the current HTML5 Video player limitations*?
How about having the technology bringing, for the very first time, *total graphic and features freedom, working with pixel-perfect rendering on any browser and the latest mobile platforms*?

No, this is not a dream: introducing *the world’s first HTML5 Video Player Framework*! We call it: *SublimeVideo Horizon*.
It's the result of more than a year of hard and super challenging work. Putting our HTML5 Video player technology *miles ahead of anything else on the market*!

Now what about our SublimeVideo.net Cloud player service designed for every website? We won't let our loyal users down:
Introducing *"the new Modular SublimeVideo Player":http://sublimevideo.net/modular-player* (beta)!
<img src="http://blog.jilion.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/12/sublimevideo_modular_player.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo Modular Player" style="float:left;margin:20px 10px -30px -10px" /> It now uses Horizon’s technology as well! As its name indicates, it is now fully modular. This means *we completely changed its "pricing":http://sublimevideo.net/pricing model* too! *You now only pay for the features you need!* So "sign up":http://sublimevideo.net/signup now and *start assembling your player with our add-ons now!*

<img src="http://blog.jilion.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/12/sublimevideo_new_players.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo New Player Designs" style="float:right;margin:0 -10px 0 10px" /> And don’t miss our new player designs! *Horizon makes any design possible*, working perfectly on any platform! We still provide the “Classic” player and *are introducing two new player designs: the “Flat” and “Light” players*, with more to come.

*Learn more about all the new features* on the "SublimeVideo Modular Player page":http://sublimevideo.net/modular-player!

Oh, and don’t forget to take a look at *the upcoming add-ons*, so you can let us know what you think we should offer next!

Last but not least, *did someone say YouTube?*
What? YouTube?

<img src="http://blog.jilion.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/12/sublimevideo_youtube.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo YouTube" style="float:left;margin:10px 18px 0 0px" /> Yes, this is H-U-G-E: Now you no longer have to choose between SublimeVideo and YouTube. The great folks at YouTube have recently made an amazing job of updating their Player API in order to go beyond Flash-only integrations. Thanks to that, *we are now delivering seamless YouTube integration with SublimeVideo*! Just specify the YouTube video's ID and that's it!

This means you can now have *the best of both worlds, using YouTube to host your videos and SublimeVideo as your ultimate branded player*!

You can imagine how excited we are with all these announcements. Frankly, we often doubted during 2012 that it would be possible for anyone to create the Horizon Framework.

But here it is today! And we’re sure you will agree with us that it’s a great milestone, if not a revolution for HTML5 Video!

Now there is much work ahead. One of our top priorities will be to "give developers access to Horizon in 2013":http://sublimevideo.net/horizon-framework#opening-horizon-to-developers.

In the meantime, we wish you Happy HTML5 Holidays with SublimeVideo Horizon and all its new features!
