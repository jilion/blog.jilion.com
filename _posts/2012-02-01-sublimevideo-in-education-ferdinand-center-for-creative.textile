For the third and final part in this series, we’d like to introduce another kind of educational user:

h4. Ferdinand Center for the Creative (The Philippines)

Ferdinand Center for the Creative is a nonprofit in the Philippines working to help young artists become accomplished graphic designers, get great jobs, and escape poverty.

At the same time, I knew that a large segment of our audience views our site from older, outdated PCs at internet cafes around the Philippines, so we needed to be compatible with a large assortment of browsers.</p><p>Any video player we chose needed to be elegant, and as un-branded as possible, to let our own brand shine. I’m a very details-oriented graphic designer, but I’m no coder, so it needed to be simple to implement and not require problem-solving on my part. I’m happy to say that SublimeVideo has a gorgeous, but non-disruptive user interface, and was a piece of cake to get set up and running. And when I had server-side caching problems completely unrelated to SublimeVideo, your wonderful tech support even helped me get that solved too!”</p></blockquote>
