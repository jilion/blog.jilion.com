Jilion is about to launch "Aelios":http://aeliosapp.com, our first iPad app!

Please visit "Aelios' teaser page":http://aeliosapp.com and sign up to be notified when it becomes available on the App Store, which we plan to be later this month.

We believe that Aelios will redefine its category and we hope you will like it!
We won’t reveal much more just yet, but here’s a hint: it’s something you may want to use every day.
