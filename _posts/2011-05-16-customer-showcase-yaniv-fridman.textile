Yaniv Fridman is a freelance director and motion graphic designer from Mexico City, currently working for companies in Vancouver, Toronto and Los Angeles. He mainly works remotely, and depends on his online portfolio to reach both current and future clients. Yaniv built his site purely to showcase his video and motion graphics work, all of which is served up by SublimeVideo Player.

I did some research and tested most of today's HTML5 players and Sublime was by far the sexiest looking and easiest to implement.</p> <p>The Sublime team was extremely helpful and fast answering my questions and solving the issues I had along the way. SublimeVideo player gave me an option to build an HTML5 site without using a portfolio template that now works on all platforms and devices. I definitely recommend it to any creative person looking for a video player that meets todays standards with a clean and elegant design.”</p></blockquote>
