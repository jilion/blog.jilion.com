Jilion and <a href="http://www.caprices.ch/">Caprices Festival</a> just launched a very interesting social networking integration of Facebook and MySpace in a music festival website.

Caprices Festival approached us back in October with the goal to be one of the first, if not the first music festival allowing people to influence a great part of the festival's lineup, by voting for artists willing to enroll in the competition. It's worth to mention those artists have not been previously selected by the organizers.

Launched on January 15, the service allows, on one hand, MySpace artists to quickly submit their profile to Caprices (via MySpaceID), and on the other hand any Facebook user to vote for them (via Facebook Connect).
As a result 6 "elected" acts per day on 3 stages will play at Caprices next April.

We are very pleased by the early results:

* In the first 6 days, more than 11'000 Facebook users joined the contest. Previously, Caprices took 3 years to attract ~2500 members on their Facebook group;
* More than 400 artists are participating so far;
* More than 150 MySpace artists have been proposed so far by Facebook users.

Few comparable websites relying only on their own sign-up can record 11?000 users in the first 6 days. Facebook is a "no-brainer" for users to sign-up as it is a very convenient process for someone already having a Facebook account.
A proper integration with a leading social network definitely helps to bootstrap a new service as the incentive always exists for users to propagate new kinds of "cool" actions back on their profile's news feed.
