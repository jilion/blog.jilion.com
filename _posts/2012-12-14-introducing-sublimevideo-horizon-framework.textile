This is simply the most important series of announcements we ever made!

h3. SublimeVideo Horizon

After more than a year of hard work, we couldn’t be more excited and proud to announce the release of "SublimeVideo Horizon":http://sublimevideo.net/horizon-framework.

<img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2012/12/sublimevideo_modular_player.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo Modular Player" style="float:left;margin:0px 15px -30px -10px" /> Today, we are also announcing our new "SublimeVideo Modular Player":http://sublimevideo.net/modular-player, which has been rewritten from the ground-up with Horizon’s technology. It’s more reliable than ever, it vastly improves mobile support and adds a lot of new features, thanks to its new modular architecture, including:

h4. YouTube Integration

<img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2012/12/sublimevideo_youtube.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo YouTube" style="float:right;margin:10px 10px 0 10px" /> This is pretty big! Now you no longer have to choose between SublimeVideo and YouTube. The great folks at YouTube have recently made an amazing job of updating their Player API in order to go beyond Flash-only integrations. Thanks to that, we are now delivering seamless "YouTube integration with SublimeVideo":http://sublimevideo.net/youtube. Just specify the YouTube video's ID and that's it!

This means you can now have the best of both worlds, using YouTube to host your videos and SublimeVideo as your unrivaled branded player!

h4. Player Designs

<img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2012/12/sublimevideo_new_players.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo New Player Designs" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 0 -10px" /> Horizon makes any player design possible, working perfectly on "any browser and the latest mobile devices":http://docs.sublimevideo.net/beta/supported-platforms. Today, along with our current “Classic” player, we now offer two new designs, the "“Flat” and “Light” Player":http://sublimevideo.net/modular-player#player_designs, with more designs to come.

h4. Add-on Pricing Model

We also completely updated the SublimeVideo Modular Player "pricing model":http://sublimevideo.net/pricing to make it flexible: Now you only pay for the features you choose! So sign up now and start assembling your player with our new add-ons.

This is just the beginning of our journey, there is much work ahead. Stay tuned because 2013 should be full of great news for our users.

In the meantime, we wish you Happy HTML5 Holidays with SublimeVideo Horizon and all its new features!
