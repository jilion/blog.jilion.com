<img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2012/05/ford-logo.png" alt="Ford’s logo" style="float:left;margin:-10px 15px 0 0" /> Ford recently launched a "video-centric competition":http://swapyourridegiveaway.com/ offering the opportunity to swap your car for one of 10 of their latest vehicles. Participants watch a video of their favourite car and answer a question for the chance to win. The contest runs until May 31st.

You can check out the competition at "swapyourridegiveaway.com":http://swapyourridegiveaway.com.

We're happy that Ford and digital agency "Flash Point Communications":http://www.flashpointcommunications.com trusted SublimeVideo to reliably power the core functionality of their Swap Your Ride campaign.

We previously saw Nissan embrace both HTML5 and SublimeVideo in their "Zen to Z web campaign":http://blog.jilion.com/2011/11/24/nissan-s-zen-to-z-web-campaign-powered-by-html5-and-sublimevideo.
