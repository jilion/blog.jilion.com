We've long been fans of the TWiT Network, and founder Leo Laporte was even one of the first tech journalists to cover the original SublimeVideo demo back in February 2010 (see "MacBreak Weekly 178":http://twit.tv/show/macbreak-weekly/178 from 11:15). 

We’re delighted to be able to share that TWiT is now using SublimeVideo for all of their shows! Simply head over to "TWiT.tv/shows":http://twit.tv/shows to quickly select and enjoy any of the network's shows with SublimeVideo.

This comes as part of a "larger effort":http://inside.twit.tv/blog/2012/2/23/streams-and-downloads-and-codecs-oh-my.html at TWiT to improve the quality of the network's video output, including a new encoding and publishing system, and a move to new video formats for all shows.

TWiT controls every stage of the production of their shows, from recording to post-production and encoding. SublimeVideo was the missing piece of the puzzle; a modern HTML5 player that integrated smoothly with TWiT’s existing infrastructure and ensures their shows always reach every member of their Web audience
