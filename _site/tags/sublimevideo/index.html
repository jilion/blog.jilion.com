    <p>We&#8217;ve long been fans of the TWiT Network, and founder Leo Laporte was even one of the first tech journalists to cover the original SublimeVideo demo back in February 2010 (see <a href="http://twit.tv/show/macbreak-weekly/178">MacBreak Weekly 178</a> from 11:15).</p>
<p>We’re delighted to be able to share that TWiT is now using SublimeVideo for all of their shows! Simply head over to <a href="http://twit.tv/shows">TWiT.tv/shows</a> to quickly select and enjoy any of the network&#8217;s shows with SublimeVideo.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2012/03/sublimevideo_on_twit_tv.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo on TWiT.tv" /></p>
<p>This comes as part of a <a href="http://inside.twit.tv/blog/2012/2/23/streams-and-downloads-and-codecs-oh-my.html">larger effort</a> at TWiT to improve the quality of the network&#8217;s video output, including a new encoding and publishing system, and a move to new video formats for all shows.</p>
<p>TWiT controls every stage of the production of their shows, from recording to post-production and encoding. SublimeVideo was the missing piece of the puzzle; a modern HTML5 player that integrated smoothly with TWiT’s existing infrastructure and ensures their shows always reach every member of their Web audience.</p>

We profiled <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2012/03/05/sublimevideo-in-production-wyld-stallyons">Wyld Stallyons</a> in the UK, <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2012/03/06/sublimevideo-in-production-garlic">Garlic</a> in Spain and <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2012/03/07/sublimevideo-in-production-so-loud-music">So Loud Music</a> in New York City.</p>

<h4>Margaret Malandruccolo (Los Angeles, <span class="caps">USA</span>)</h4>
<p>Margaret is a professional photographer and director in Los Angeles, California. She’s worked with a range of well-known brands, musicians and publications including Nike, Canon, Toyota, Juliette Lewis, Queens of the Stone Age and Billboard Magazine.</p>
<p>Margaret’s site was developed by web designer and developer David Andrews (<a href="http://www.madeofpixels.ca">Made of Pixels</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2012/02/margaret_malandruccolo.jpg" alt="Margaret Malandruccolo" class="no_rounded" style="float:left;margin:7px 22px 0 0" /> “SublimeVideo ensured the player looked consistent across all browsers, including the HTML5 and Flash modes. We felt it was important not to detract from the surrounding content, so a player that looked different in various forms wasn&#8217;t an option.</p><p>SublimeVideo&#8217;s <span class="caps">API</span> was flexible enough to allow for the site&#8217;s desired presentation of motion content, and worked seamlessly for both the Flash and HTML5 versions of the player. Other players had different ways to communicate with each implementation (Flash vs. HTML5), or they were still in beta.</p><p>Automatic updates meant the player always incorporated the latest enhancements and bug fixes, without the need to check for and replace an older version of the player on the site. This ensures users always get the latest version of the player, without any action on their part or ours.</p><p>Finally, it was dead simple to add video content to the site and have it work as needed, especially considering we use only one video instance for multiple thumbnails. Easy integration makes for happy programmers.”</p></blockquote>

<p>So Loud Music is a music and sound design studio in New York City. So Loud’s team members have experience collaborating with a variety of well known artists and major labels, and now work with with clients including American Express, Canon, <span class="caps">BMW</span>, Pepsi and Verizon.</p>

We needed a solution which would give our clients a consistent experience. We are in a creative business, and creating a consistent experience helps our clients to focus on our amazing music for advertising portfolio, instead of focusing on the technology.</p><p>The technology to implement a consistent web experience needs to be seamless, invisible, and work as expected&#8230; Easier said than done.  When So Loud Music found SublimeVideo as a means to showcase our music portfolio, we knew we had our answer.  SublimeVideo has the solution we need to showcase the music that we create for video, while creating a consistent experience across all platforms.”</p></blockquote>

After hours of testing and comparing the top solutions, we finally chose SublimeVideo Player for a variety of reasons. Specifically, the perfect cross-browser/platform compatibility and beautiful look and feel.”</p></blockquote>

    <p>Video is a powerful and often vital tool for showcasing creative work online. This week we’ll be taking a look at a handful of <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo</a> users who provide professional production services to well known clients around the world.</p>
<p>Introducing part one of four: Wyld Stallyons.</p>

<h4>Wyld Stallyons (London, UK)</h4>
<p>Wyld Stallyons is a moving image production company in London. Since 2006 they’ve produced video content for clients in the music, broadcast and advertising industries including Honda, Bacardi, Ministry of Sound, Philips and three major UK TV channels.</p>
<blockquote><p><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2012/02/jason_arber_wyld_stallyons.jpg" alt="Jason Arber - Director at Wyld Stallyons" class="no_rounded" style="float:left;margin:7px 22px 0 0" /> “We chose SublimeVideo as our video delivery mechanism because we believed that native MP4 delivery of our videos was the best choice for visitors to our site. We don&#8217;t yet live in a world where every visitor can view MP4 videos natively, so we needed a solution that degraded gracefully back to Flash-wrapped videos for people using older browsers.</p><p>We looked at several offerings, but only SublimeVideo combined great aesthetics with an easy to use (and easy to implement) product. Being able to quickly and easily see how many videos had been served was a great bonus, too. Jillion were very quick to respond to our initial questions and their obvious commitment to making a cool, seamless product impressed us. Since our new site went live, we&#8217;ve been extremely happy with SublimeVideo. Nice work guys!”</p></blockquote>

    <p>We’ve previously profiled software developers who’ve chosen <a href="http://sublimevideo.net/">SublimeVideo</a> to showcase videos of their products online, including tap tap tap’s <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2011/06/01/customer-showcase-camera-plus">Camera+</a> iPhone app, <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2012/01/16/customer-showcase-own-point-of-sale">Own’s social point of sale platform</a> and MediaMolecule’s <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2011/04/15/customer-showcase-media-molecule-littlebigplanet2">LittleBigPlanet 2</a> for Playstation 3.</p>
<p>Today we’d like to introduce a SublimeVideo user whose software is used in several different creative fields:</p>
<p><span class="caps">VDMX</span> &#8211; Professional VJ Software &#8211; <a href="http://vidvox.net/">http://vidvox.net</a><br />
<a href="http://vidvox.net/" title="Visit vidvox.net"><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2012/02/sublimevideo_vidvox.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo on VDMX - Professional VJ Software" /></a></p>
<p><span class="caps">VDMX</span> is a realtime multimedia performance application developed by New York-based Mac software company <span class="caps">VIDVOX</span>. <span class="caps">VDMX</span> has been used in concert with The Beastie Boys, The Grateful Dead, Phoenix and Aphex Twin, and by many other musicians, design firms, theater groups, and experimental filmmakers around the world.</p>
<p>Former <span class="caps">VIDVOX</span> co-manager Jack Turner’s design agency <a href="http://jackadam.net">jackadam</a> produced the website for <span class="caps">VDMX</span> and <span class="caps">VIDVOX</span>. They chose SublimeVideo to showcase a variety of high-quality videos of <span class="caps">VDMX</span> in action, ranging from live audiovisual performances to motion graphics and segments of animated work produced with the software.</p>
<blockquote><p><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2012/02/jack_turner_vidvox.jpg" alt="Lester Nelson - Ferdinand Center for the Creative" class="no_rounded" style="float:left;margin:7px 22px 0 0" /> “SublimeVideo was absolutely crucial in pulling off the video gallery on <span class="caps">VIDVOX</span>.net for a multitude of reasons. Being able to control how the videos were compressed was a requirement from the get-go. Video art &amp; concert video tends to involve a lot of quick cuts, fast motion and/or stroboscopic effects and all of these require carefully tuned compression-settings to keep the video from becoming “artifact salad”. If we had gone with a hosted video service, many of these videos would have just looked like total mush. Video art and hosted video services just don&#8217;t mix well.</p><p>We also required something that had an easy to use JavaScript <span class="caps">API</span> &#8211; mucking directly with &lt;video&gt; elements would have consumed an unfathomable amount of development time. With SublimeVideo it only took a couple of lines of JS to create a video player when the lights go down, and one more line to destroy it when you return to the rest of the site.</p><p>HD support and stats didn&#8217;t even exist when we started the site but we quickly integrated both of these. Getting new features and expanded browser continuously is a godsend when dealing with something like video on the web.”</p></blockquote>

    <p>We recently introduced a <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2011/11/29/sublimevideo-unleashed">major update to SublimeVideo</a>. The biggest new feature added to the service was our Universal, Real-Time Statistics platform.</p>
<p>SublimeVideo&#8217;s statistics platform is the first to offer a truly <strong>comprehensive, real-time overview of your site&#8217;s video traffic from any device, whether generated from mobile or desktop, HTML5 or Flash</strong>.</p>
<p>We’ve prepared a <a href="https://my.sublimevideo.net/sites/stats/demo">live demo</a> of our Real-Time Statistics dashboard so you can try it out for yourself. Please note that the demo requires a modern browser that supports HTML5. We recommend using the latest version of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera or IE9.</p>
<p><a href="https://my.sublimevideo.net/sites/stats/demo"><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2012/02/sublimevideo-integrated-real-time-statistics-demo.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo Universal Real-Time Statistics" /></a><br />
<em class="caption">Check out the live demo.</em></p>
<h4>Real-Time &amp; Universal</h4>
<p>SublimeVideo gives our users instant access to a range of statistics about their videos, all in <strong>real-time</strong>. This simply wouldn&#8217;t be possible without SublimeVideo&#8217;s cloud-based infrastructure.</p>
<p>In addition, SublimeVideo Player reports consistent statistics from all platforms (HTML5 and Flash on both desktop and mobile). Because of this, we&#8217;re able to collect data from all devices and present a comprehensive, <strong>universal</strong> overview of a user’s site&#8217;s video traffic. This is increasingly important as the web transitions to HTML5 and more people access content from different platforms and devices.</p>

<p>You can find more information on our <a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net/real-time-stats">documentation page</a>.</p>
<h4>Under the hood</h4>
<p>We built a sophisticated architecture to power SublimeVideo’s Real-Time Statistics; SublimeVideo Player &#8216;reports&#8217; every load / play. Then, every 60 seconds, our <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>-hosted <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> backend workers parse and separate statistics logs by time period (days / hours / minutes), before storing them in a <a href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> database.</p>
<p>These stats are then displayed on the user&#8217;s stats dashboard (which is implemented using Rails, <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a> and <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>). The graphs automatically refresh themselves every 60 seconds, so there&#8217;s no need to manually refresh the page.</p>
<p>We use a different setup for stats from the last 60 seconds (available only with paid plans); here, SublimeVideo Player ‘reports’ plays / loads to our Ruby async server (<a href="http://cramp.in">Cramp</a>), also hosted on Heroku.</p>
<p>Plays and loads over the last 60 seconds are stored on the same MongoDB database and pushed directly &#8211; in real time &#8211; to the user’s stats dashboard via <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a>. Keeping the period covering the last 60 seconds in sync everywhere was a nice technical challenge; we created a tiny &#8216;ticker&#8217; app, which pushes each second via a public Pusher channel.</p>
<p>Real-Time Statistics are available with our Plus and Premium paid plans, while Standard statistics for the last 24 hours are available with our new, Free &amp; Unlimited plan.</p>
<h4>Tell us what you want next</h4>
<p>With the first version of our player-integrated statistics we&#8217;ve laid the foundations for more features to come.</p>
<p>Please share your comments and suggestions about how you think we can improve our statistics platform on this <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/sublimevideo/topics/comments_suggestions_for_sublimevideos_real_time_statistics_platform">SublimeVideo Community Forum thread</a>.</p>

    <p>This week we’ve taken a look at some educational establishments using <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo</a>, and profiled <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2012/01/30/sublimevideo-in-education-sewanee-university">Sewanee: The University of the South</a> and <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2012/01/31/sublimevideo-in-education-anc-secondary-schools"><span class="caps">ANC</span> Secondary Schools</a>.</p>
<p>For the third and final part in this series, we’d like to introduce another kind of educational user:</p>

Ferdinand Center for the Creative &#8211; <a href="http://www.ferdinandcc.org">http://www.ferdinandcc.org</a></p>
<h4>Ferdinand Center for the Creative (The Philippines)</h4>
<p>Ferdinand Center for the Creative is a nonprofit in the Philippines working to help young artists become accomplished graphic designers, get great jobs, and escape poverty.</p>
<blockquote><p><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2012/02/lester_nelson_ferdinand_cc.jpg" alt="Lester Nelson - Ferdinand Center for the Creative" class="no_rounded" style="float:left;margin:7px 22px 0 0" /> “Ferdinand Center for the Creative is a progressive organization, and when it came to posting videos, I wanted us to support HTML5 first and foremost, with Flash as a fallback, not the other way round. At the same time, I knew that a large segment of our audience views our site from older, outdated PCs at internet cafes around the Philippines, so we needed to be compatible with a large assortment of browsers.</p><p>Any video player we chose needed to be elegant, and as un-branded as possible, to let our own brand shine. I’m a very details-oriented graphic designer, but I’m no coder, so it needed to be simple to implement and not require problem-solving on my part. I’m happy to say that SublimeVideo has a gorgeous, but non-disruptive user interface, and was a piece of cake to get set up and running. And when I had server-side caching problems completely unrelated to SublimeVideo, your wonderful tech support even helped me get that solved too!”</p></blockquote>

At the time, we were in the process of redeveloping our homepage (using HTML5), and SublimeVideo felt like great timing for our video player needs.</p><p>Some may question “why use a paid solution to deliver HTML5 video when there are many free alternatives available?” With SublimeVideo the answer is straightforward: a wonderful interface, responsive support, and ease of use both for us and our users. The peace of mind SublimeVideo brings us is why we were happy to be a paid customer.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Wing is a London-based creative visual agency specializing in delivering innovative, targeted campaigns. Wing have created ads, promotional videos and other short form content for such leading brands as Coca Cola, Puma, Lotus, McLaren and Hugo Boss.</p>
<p>UK-based digital agency <a href="http://www.slipstreamstudio.com">Slipstream</a> developed Wing&#8217;s video-driven site, and chose SublimeVideo to power their video portfolio. Using SublimeVideo <span class="caps">API</span> (<a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net/javascript-api/methods#resize">resize method</a>), Slipstream implemented a custom &#8216;Cinema Mode&#8217; to instantly enlarge any video on the Wing site.</p>

Slipstream developed a custom video management and encoding platform for Wing, and really needed a player that we could integrate as quickly as possible. Wing also needed to be able to present the results of their campaigns to their clients, so finding a video player with integrated statistics was vital.</p><p>In SublimeVideo we found everything we needed and more, and come back to it as our player of choice for every project.”</p></blockquote>

    <p>Today we&#8217;re announcing a major update to SublimeVideo:</p>
<p><a href="http://sublimevideo.net"><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2011/11/sublimevideo_free_and_unlimited.png" alt="SublimeVideo Now Free &amp; Unlimited" style="position:relative;left:-10px" /></a></p>
<h4>New, Free and Unlimited SublimeVideo HTML5 Video Player</h4>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to introduce a new, free and unlimited version of <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo</a>.</p>
<p>After the commercial launch of SublimeVideo earlier this year, and alongside today’s introduction of great, cloud-powered new features, we’re ready to <strong>shift gear and introduce something radical</strong> that we’ve wanted to do for a while: <strong>Give anyone a free, traffic unlimited, no-compromise</strong> version of SublimeVideo Player.</p>
<h4>Contributing to the web’s transition to HTML5 Video</h4>
<p>We started SublimeVideo last year because <strong>we wanted to turn the promises of HTML5 Video into a reality</strong> &#8211; to make web video simpler and more enjoyable for everybody.</p>
<p>Adobe&#8217;s recent decision to stop development of Mobile Flash and fully embrace HTML5 is <strong>a clear signal that HTML5 is now mandatory for all sites</strong>.</p>
<p>SublimeVideo already provides any website with a fast, reliable and pain-free way to migrate from Flash to HTML5 Video. The new, free plan now makes it <strong>accessible to anyone</strong>. We’re really happy to be able to do this; we see it as <strong>our contribution to a better and more modern Web</strong>.</p>
<h4>Enhanced Paid Plans</h4>
<p><a href="http://sublimevideo.net/plans"><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2011/11/sublimevideo_plans.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo Plans" /></a></p>
<p>In addition to our new free plan, we’re also introducing <strong>enhanced paid plans</strong> with amazing <strong>new Real-Time Stats</strong> (more details below) and <strong>far larger monthly viewing allowances</strong>!</p>
<p>Not only do we now give you many more views, but we&#8217;ve also switched the metric used to measure your player views from <em>Video Pageviews</em> (counted every time the page containing your video loads) to <em>Video Plays</em> (counted only when playback of your video starts).</p>
<p>The new <em>Plus</em> plan is available for $9.90 per site/month and $99 per site/year, and replaces the <em>Comet</em> plan. The new <em>Premium</em> plan is available for $49.90 per site/month and $499 per site/year, and replaces the <em>Planet</em>, <em>Star</em> and <em>Galaxy</em> Plans.</p>
<p>Existing customers: Don&#8217;t worry! Your plans have automatically been upgraded to our new, enhanced offerings. Visit <a href="https://docs.sublimevideo.net/plan-migration">this page</a> for more details on how you&#8217;ve been updated.</p>
<h4>Universal, Real-Time Stats</h4>
<p><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2011/11/sublimevideo_stats.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo Real-Time Stats" style="float:left;margin:8px 26px 5px 0" />Today, we&#8217;re also introducing a great new feature to our paid plans: Universal, Real-Time Statistics for any platform!</p>
<p>We think our new stats platform is quite unique: As far as we know it’s the world’s first to offer a truly <strong>comprehensive, real-time picture</strong> of your site&#8217;s video traffic, <strong>whether generated from mobile or desktop, HTML5 or Flash</strong>.</p>
<p>Our Real-Time Statistics platform leverages the power of SublimeVideo’s cloud-based technology and <strong>lays the foundations for even more great new features to come</strong>. Please let us know what you think and what you’d like to see next in our new <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/sublimevideo">Community Forum</a>.</p>
<p>Users of our new, free plan also have access to stats for the past 24 hours, and can easily upgrade to our paid plans offering real-time stats and longer data retention (with yearly or unlimited stats storage).</p>
<h4>HD Switching, Video Embeds and Community Forum</h4>
<p>We’ve also added two important features to our player, which we ensured work perfectly in HTML5: HD Switching and Video Embeds.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2011/11/sublimevideo_hd.png" alt="SublimeVideo HD" style="float:left;margin:14px 16px 2px 0" />You can now switch SD-HD video sources with a single click using the HD switch built straight into the player&#8217;s UI. To the end user it may just look like an ordinary HD switch, <strong>but we took great care to implement it properly</strong> so that it <strong>fully complies with the HTML5 standard</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2011/11/sublimevideo_embed.png" alt="SublimeVideo Embed" style="float:left;margin:14px 16px 2px 0" />The addition of our free plan and larger monthly viewing allowances to our paid plans means that we can now offer SublimeVideo embeds, allowing your audience to easily embed your videos into their own sites or around the web.</p>
<p>Read more about the new player features on our <a href="http://sublimevideo.net/features">Features page</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we&#8217;re launching a new <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/sublimevideo">Community Forum</a> on GetSatisfaction which you can use to report bugs, share your ideas and ask us questions. <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">Sign up for SublimeVideo</a> to join the community today and let us know what you’d like to see next!</p>
<p>We hope you’ll enjoy the new SublimeVideo as much as we do! <strong>A big thank you to our customers for their continued support</strong> &#8230;and welcome to our new users!</p>

<p>Car manufacturers have traditionally relied heavily on Flash to implement and deliver big web campaigns such as this. Nissan’s new campaign is <strong>built entirely with HTML5</strong> and makes significant use of video.</p>

<p><strong>We’re thrilled they decided to rely on <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo</a> to deliver their video message</strong>.

<p>To many of those who follow our blog, <span class="caps">CSS</span>-Tricks probably needs no introduction. A popular web design community with the simply-stated goal of making websites better, <span class="caps">CSS</span>-Tricks is a treasure trove of knowledge for all web designers.</p>
<p>Articles and tutorials keep the community on the cutting-edge, while a broad library of code snippets and downloadable projects helps developers get hands-on. Founder Chris Coyier chose SublimeVideo to power all of the community’s video screencasts, and recently <a href="http://css-tricks.com/14497-making-sublimevideo-fluid-width/">wrote a great post</a> on our player’s new fluid-width capabilities.</p>
<p>We’d highly recommend checking out <span class="caps">CSS</span>-Tricks to anyone looking to learn more about the latest capabilities of ever-evolving web standards.</p>

In the case of <span class="caps">CSS</span>-Tricks, I have a whole archive of videos that are essentially self-hosted. I want those videos to be watchable by anybody on any browser. But because different browsers need different things to make that happen, it&#8217;s not trivially easy. There are some great free projects that do similar things, but the value for me in SublimeVideo is that I don&#8217;t have to worry about upgrading to new versions or troubleshooting for the browser landscape. Even though I&#8217;m the kind of guy who keeps up on HTML5 stuff, I still love it that I don&#8217;t have to worry about it.</p><p>Another part of making sure videos are watchable by anyone is making sure the videos fit and look good in any browser. For my design, that means the videos need to be fluid with. I&#8217;m happy that SublimeVideo provides the necessary things to make that possible.”</p></blockquote>

As a result, I specifically wanted a player that 1) could reach multiple formats, 2) avoided flash unless necessary, 3) was friendly to use, and 4) was damn good looking.</p><p>SublimeVideo caught my eye last year, and with the hosted launch, it was my first choice.

A year ago we launched the <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2010/09/14/sublimevideo-beta-starts-today">SublimeVideo Beta</a> and were totally overwhelmed by the response of the HTML5 and video communities.</p>
<p>Throughout the beta and since our <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2011/03/30/sublimevideo-is-commercially-available">commercial launch</a> in March we&#8217;ve gained some truly amazing users. We&#8217;ve been making an effort to profile some of them in a series of <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/tags/customer-showcase">Customer Showcases</a> — check it out to see some of the fantastic ways people are using SublimeVideo.</p>
<p>Our cloud-based model has worked as we had hoped, allowing us to administer <a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net/releases">61 transparent updates</a> since launching the beta; improving compatibility, fixing bugs and adding functionality to all of our users players without them ever needing to lift a finger. We are also proud to be able to say that there have so far been zero interruptions to the delivery of the player.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to thank the SublimeVideo community for all of your help and support, we couldn&#8217;t have gotten where we are today without you. Finally, we’d like to let you all know that we have some big announcements planned before the end of the year &#8211; stay tuned to find out more.</p>

After trying out numerous other (free) alternatives I&#8217;d always come across a random bug or browser issue that meant they couldn&#8217;t be used in a production environment — then along came Sublime, and just worked flawlessly first time.

    <p>We have some exciting news for all the HTML5 enthusiasts out there: true HTML5 fullscreen video playback is now possible, and we’ve built it right into <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">our player</a>.</p>
<p>Until now, the lack of true fullscreen playback has been the biggest limitation of HTML5 over Flash video. Safari already offered a basic fullscreen option for HTML5 video players, but this was via a non-customizable QuickTime view that didn’t allow the player to be branded or to feature custom controls.</p>
<p>For the first time since we <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2010/01/25/introducing-sublimevideo">demoed our player last year</a>, we can finally enjoy SublimeVideo’s HTML5 controls in <a href="http://cl.ly/8owo">glorious fullscreen</a>.</p>
<p>This is a cutting-edge feature and we are breaking new ground by being the first video player to implement it. Right now it requires the very latest version of Safari 5.1, but Chrome and Firefox support should arrive soon<sup><a href="#fn-2011-07-27-1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><em class="caption">Click on the fullscreen button or double click on the video to enter fullscreen.<br /> Safari 5.1 required.</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve <a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net/releases#2011-07-26-14-03">now</a> enabled this feature on all instances of SublimeVideo Player. However, because this is a brand new feature that is currently only available in Safari, for now we have left the traditional <a href="http://cl.ly/8oKv">full-window</a> behavior as the default player option. If you are running Safari 5.1, simply hold down Command (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) while clicking the player’s full-window button to enjoy true fullscreen HTML5 playback<sup><a href="#fn-2011-07-27-2">2</a></sup>. You can also double-click the video whilst holding the modifier key to activate fullscreen. You can test it yourself on <a href="http://blog.jilion.com/tags/customer-showcase">some of our customers&#8217; sites</a>!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more SublimeVideo news and developments.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong>: October 11, 2011: We <a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net/releases#2011-10-11-15-18">added</a> True HTML5 fullscreen support for the upcoming <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox 10</a>.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

Rock am Ring &#8211; <a href="http://www.rock-am-ring.com">http://www.rock-am-ring.com</a></p>
<p><em>Rock am Ring</em> and <em>Rock im Park</em> are simultaneous rock festivals held annually in Germany. With headline acts over the years including bands such as Metallica, Kiss, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Prodigy and even Coldplay, and combined attendances of just over 150,000 people, they are two of the largest and most popular music festivals in the world.</p>
<p>Makalu Media &#8211; the company behind the official website &#8211; knew that it was vital to give visitors the best video experience whilst watching festival content online. We’re thrilled that they chose SublimeVideo Player to showcase the videos from this year’s festival.</p>

We liked that it looks the same with Flash or HTML5 video (that was important to our customer; they didn&#8217;t want to know about different video types, etc; they just didn&#8217;t want the look to change at any time), and (most importantly) that it was super-easy to implement. The ease-of-implementation saved us a lot of time.”</p></blockquote>

i-Cast 2.0 Replica &#8211; <a href="http://icast2.brax.se">http://icast2.brax.se</a></p>
<p>Tetra Pak developed an internal video publishing and distribution platform called i-Cast to improve the accessibility and sharing of digital video within the company. Today, the highly scalable platform serves well over 1,000 videos over the company’s intranet, and can be accessed from over 200 local offices in 150 countries worldwide. The developers chose to implement SublimeVideo Player to handle playback of all of their video content. The replica system currently available online contains far less video content, but is otherwise identical.</p>

Now, whether our users access the training videos from their desktop or mobile device, we know they&#8217;ll enjoy the same gorgeous interface and ease of use.</p><p>Best of all, since we began using the SublimeVideo Player, more than 50 bug fixes and new features have been automatically added—without us having to do anything at all. This not only frees up our time, but also provides much-welcome peace of mind.”</p></blockquote>

Small Change &#8211; <a href="http://www.smallchangeshort.com">http://www.smallchangeshort.com</a></p>
<p><em>Small Change</em> is an independent short film that tells the story of how a young, single mother’s desperate hope for a big win on the slot machines causes her world to spiral out of control. The film received a lot of attention from such film festivals as Galway and Sundance, and CherryRed Pictures knew they needed an impressive site to help promote the film. They implemented SublimeVideo Player to give viewers the best possible viewing experience when watching the film’s trailer.</p>
<blockquote><p><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2011/05/mark_weir_cherryred_pictures.jpg" alt="Mark Weir - CherryRED Pictures" class="no_rounded" style="float:left;margin:7px 22px 0 0" /> “One of the main points I wanted to address during the design was how the trailer would stream. After years of using Flash for video I wanted to get away from it and allow iOS and other mobile devices to be able to watch it natively. The trailer was the most important part of the site so I spent a lot of time looking into HTML5 video but was aware we needed to make sure older browsers had a Flash fallback. I had tried a few solutions but nothing wrapped it all up so nicely like the Sublime service. When I showed Cathy a demo she loved the interface and the zoom/full screen options. I had already signed up for the beta earlier and incidentally I got my invite just few days after deciding it was the service for us.</p><p>Our visitors have noted on the player and how well it matches the look of the site and it&#8217;s ease of use. For us it meant when we were out and about we could show people our trailer with our iPhones on the spot and at the same time showing off the rest of the site.”</p></blockquote>

I did some research and tested most of today&#8217;s HTML5 players and Sublime was by far the sexiest looking and easiest to implement.</p> <p>The Sublime team was extremely helpful and fast answering my questions and solving the issues I had along the way. SublimeVideo player gave me an option to build an HTML5 site without using a portfolio template that now works on all platforms and devices. I definitely recommend it to any creative person looking for a video player that meets todays standards with a clean and elegant design.”</p></blockquote>

Not only does it look amazing, it also works everywhere we need it to, from desktop to mobile. Plus, with its flexible JavaScript <span class="caps">API</span>, we&#8217;re able to wire it up with our internal stats tracking and keep tabs on every video it plays.

    <p>We are proud to have some great customers using <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo</a> Player. Here is the latest entry to our Customer Showcase:</p>
<p><a href="http://methodandcraft.com" title="Visit methodandcraft.com"><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2011/04/methodandcraft_sublimevideo.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo on Method &amp; Craft" /></a><br />
Method &amp; Craft &#8211; <a href="http://methodandcraft.com">http://methodandcraft.com</a></p>
<p>Launched in February 2011, Method &amp; Craft boasts a rich collection of articles, interviews, notes and videos focusing on the process of design and those who practice it. The team behind Method &amp; Craft have done a great job at designing a beautiful site that also makes it easy to find and read any of their articles, interviews and notes on design. Presenting their rapidly growing collection of videos as beautifully as their text-based content was a different challenge, and we are thrilled that they turned to SublimeVideo Player to achieve just that. If you are a designer or creative of any kind who hasn’t already done so, we’d strongly recommend checking out Method &amp; Craft.</p>

The SublimeVideo player not only delivered on that need in spades, but also looks absolutely gorgeous which is a big deal to design nerds like us.&#8221;</p>

Back in early 2010 more than a million visitors enjoyed what many considered was the best HTML5 video player on the Internet.</p>
<p>A few months later, we decided to turn <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo</a> from a tech demo into the world’s best HTML5 video player solution. We began developing an ambitious cloud-based service, allowing our customers to ensure that their video will always play flawlessly on a huge variety of browsers and mobile devices, without any extra work from them, ever.</p>
<p>6 months ago we began beta-testing SublimeVideo Player &#8211; the world&#8217;s first cloud-based HTML5 video player. This was an incredibly valuable and important period for us; it not only showed us that SublimeVideo worked and scaled flawlessly, but also allowed us to show the world the value of a universal video player service.</p>
<p>Today we are commercially launching <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo</a> &#8211; making it available to everyone.<br />
Check out our <a href="http://jilion.com/pr/2011-03-30">Press Release</a> and <a href="http://sublimevideo.net/plans">Plans &amp; Pricing</a> page to find out more and <a href="https://my.sublimevideo.net/signup">sign up today</a> if you are not already a beta tester.</p>
<p>Figuring out the right pricing model for SublimeVideo was more difficult than we had initially expected, and is something that we took great care with. The valuable data we gained from our pricing survey provided us with what we needed to finalize our commercialization plans. We would like to thank the 2,000 people who participated in this survey, and all of you who gave us amazing feedback and encouragement throughout the beta period.</p>
<p>Something that the survey results confirmed for us is that we must continue to strive for the highest possible quality product and service. As such, we decided that all plans will only be differentiated by their volume levels and not their feature sets. For example, you won&#8217;t need to purchase the biggest plan in order to access <span class="caps">SSL</span>.</p>
<p>Another element we are proud to include in all plans is Peak Insurance; a flexible feature that allows your site to exceed its video pageview limit for a certain number of days in the event of a burst of traffic, without forcing you to upgrade plans.</p>
<p>We believe that features like these display our commitment to providing customers with a top-quality service.</p>
<p>We have seen some truly fantastic implementations of SublimeVideo Player from beta users, and hope that new users will also enjoy using the superior HTML5 and universal playback of SublimeVideo to showcase their own video on thousands of new sites.</p>

    <p>If you are a developer or a curious user, you have probably found yourself often <strong>right-clicking</strong> on videos in your browser to get the contextual menu and see if they are played using Flash or HTML5.</p>
<p>Today we want to show something that you have probably <strong>never seen on the Web before</strong>: a handcrafted contextual menu that consistently works<sup><a href="#fn-2011-01-19">1</a></sup> over <span class="caps">HTML</span> and Flash and that not only shows you if the video is being played with HTML5 or Flash, but also allows you to easily switch between the two modes.</p>
<p><img style="float: left;margin: 10px 25px 0 0" src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2011/01/sublimevideo_contextual_menu_animation.gif" alt="SublimeVideo Player Mode Switching" /> We think this is a great way to highlight the universal aspect of <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">our player</a> as well as the uniform implementation of both our HTML5 and Flash modes. It is also a way to show our brand without interfering with the player interface.</p>
<p>Please try it out yourself by right-clicking on the video below! </p>

<p>It may feel odd to see this cute contextual menu when right-clicking on a Flash video ;-). If you need some proof it is really Flash or need to access the standard contextual menu, you can hold down Command (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows/Linux) while right-clicking (this trick also works in HTML5 mode and if you are developer we know you will love it).</p>
<p>To our beta users: we will release the contextual menu publicly in a few hours. We will <a href="http://twitter.com/jilion">notify you</a> and update our <a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net/releases">Release Notes</a> page when it&#8217;s ready!</p>

  <div class="entry_body">
    <p><a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo</a> Beta has started 3 months ago and we are extremely happy to report that basically everything is running great!</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net/releases"><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2010/12/SublimeVideo-Release-Notes-Screenshot.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo Release Notes Screenshot" /></a></p>
<p>Here are some information we would like to share with you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Since the Beta started, we have released 36 automatic and transparent updates of the Player to all our users, again, automatically and without bothering them. It means we updated the player in average every 3 days. You can now follow SublimeVideo player updates on our new <a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net/releases">Release Notes</a> page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>These updates were made possible thanks to the rich feedback received from our Beta testers: over 400 feedback and bug reports have been received and 98% of them answered.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>On the server side, our cloud-based infrastructure has been running smoothly from day one without any delivery interruption of the player by our <span class="caps">CDN</span> (100% uptime). Also, even if this is less visible, it is worth noting that our SublimeVideo Ruby on Rails application running on Heroku has scaled as expected along with the growth in usage, allowing us to parse large amount of data, something that will allow us to bring you really cool new features and services in the future.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>On the usage side, we wished to somehow keep a low profile during the Beta, but we are thrilled to report there are currently thousands of beta users and that the traffic is already in the range of millions of video pages served per month!</li>
</ul>
<p>At this stage of the Beta, we have now passed two important milestones:<br />
First, the Beta has confirmed the technical service is working well and will be able to scale as we enter the commercial phase.<br />
Second and maybe even more importantly, the Beta is demonstrating the value of our &#8220;SublimeVideo Universal Web Video Player as a Service&#8221; which is indeed delivering all the key benefits we expected when we announced it back in August.</p>
<p>So, you are not going to be surprised to hear we are excited!</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:15px">What&#8217;s next</h3>
<p>We are finalizing the development of the commercial release, which is scheduled for Q1 2011.</p>
<p>The pricing survey we discussed earlier will be sent out to our Beta users in January. Stay tuned, we know lots of you are waiting to know how much it will cost to start using SublimeVideo. We will do our best to please you.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we wish you all happy holidays and lots of good vibes for the new year! Thank you again for your support, it&#8217;s been an amazing year.</p>

    <p>We are happy to announce we are launching SublimeVideo Beta today and we are sending out the first wave of invitations right now.</p>
<p>A lot of you registered for the beta. We are thrilled to see the amount of requests we received and are receiving daily. If everything goes smoothly with SublimeVideo service infrastructure we will send Beta invitations to all of those who registered as quickly as possible. If you didn’t register yet, you can do it from this <a href="http://sublimevideo.net/notify">page</a>.</p>
<p>In your invitation you will be asked to create an account on <a href="https://my.sublimevideo.net">my.sublimevideo.net</a> where you will be able to generate and manage SublimeVideo players for your sites.</p>
<p><img style="position:relative;left:-5px" src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2010/09/mysublimevideo_screenshot.png" alt="MySublimeVideo Screenshot" /></p>
<p>We hope you will enjoy the super-simple process we designed for you to get your players up and running almost instantly on your sites.</p>
<p>Keep in mind SublimeVideo Player is a player, not a video hosting solution forcing you to use our service to host your videos: You retain the full flexibility to host your videos wherever you want.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net">Documentation</a> to learn more about it.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:15px">Your feedback</h3>
<p>As written earlier, SublimeVideo will be free during the Beta phase. The two main goals of this phase will be to get your feedback on the product and shape the right pricing with your help.</p>
<p>We are really looking forward to receiving your feedback!  <br />
We would love to know if you&#8217;re happy with SublimeVideo and what we can do to improve it. Please send us comments, bug reports, feature requests and suggestions for improvement using the dedicated <a href="http://my.sublimevideo.net/feedback">form</a> on MySublimeVideo.</p>

Today, as promised we let you know what we’ve been working on during the past few months. We hope you’ll like it as much as we do.</p>
<p>After 6 months of exciting work, we are extremely happy to introduce <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo.net</a>, our HTML5 Video Player as a Service.</p>
<p>Some of you were anticipating that we would distribute SublimeVideo as a <span class="caps">ZIP</span> file download.<br />
Well, today we’re offering a much better option &#8211; a real-world and practical HTML5 video player solution.</p>
<p>Our goal is simple: We really want you to get “state-of-the-art you can actually use”, instantly, easily and inexpensively.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, for 99% of our potential customers, HTML5 Video could be a real pain to deploy. Why? Because every browser has its own specificities which means you need to hire experts in HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3 to ensure your HTML5 Video Player works flawlessly in all of them. And that’s not all: To be sure your player does not break and that you always provide the best experience to your audience, you still need to maintain it continuously by following on a daily basis the evolution of numerous browsers and their versions, on various desktop and mobile platforms.<br />
This is just not realistic for the vast majority of web sites willing to enable HTML5 video.</p>
<p>Thanks to SublimeVideo HTML5 Video Player as a Service, none of this is a problem for you anymore: We take care of all that complexity, allowing you to instantly deliver to your audience the best HTML5 video experience possible on the web, worry-free!<br />
That&#8217;s the main benefit of SublimeVideo but there’s more:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Get your own SublimeVideo player up-and-running in seconds.</li>
	<li>Get your SublimeVideo player delivered to your audience globally through our fast, reliable and low-latency Content Delivery Network.</li>
	<li>Welcome to Zero Maintenance: Your SublimeVideo player is always up-to-date.</li>
	<li>Updates including bug-fixes and new platforms support are automatically deployed.</li>
	<li>Updates are near-instantaneous for our global customers base.</li>
	<li>Monitor your players usages in near real-time.</li>
	<li>Integration in your web pages is done in just one-simple-line of embed code that we generate for you.</li>
	<li>Integration can be done by mere mortals, i.e. non-developers.</li>
	<li>There are no integration costs, no deployment costs and no maintenance costs, the usual hidden costs of &#8220;free download solutions&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what&#8217;s next?<br />
What about the pricing and when can you start using SublimeVideo?</p>
<p>First of all, we would like to thank you for all the amazing feedback you sent us in the past few days since we opened our &#8220;Notify-Me&#8221; form on <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">sublimevideo.net</a>.<br />
After just two tweets, in the first days of a quiet August month, we received thousands of participation requests for our upcoming Beta!</p>
<p>In the next few days, we will start sending the first invitations for the Beta to as many people as possible.<br />
The Beta will be free while it&#8217;s on.<br />
During the Beta, we will fine-tune the service, collect your comments, and most importantly, we will work hard to define the best pricing model!</p>
<p>Shaping the right pricing model is going to be a challenging experience for us. We will need your help because we want to do our best to shape a pricing model that can fit a wide range of potential customers, from individuals to large companies.<br />
To address this pricing challenge, we plan to ask Beta testers to answer a quick survey and we will also contact some of you directly. We hope we can collectively find a solid answer to the question &#8220;What would you be willing to pay for the value SublimeVideo provides to you?&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the mean time, please have a look at our just released <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">sublimevideo.net</a> homepage, as well as our new <a href="http://sublimevideo.net/demo">demo page</a>!</p>
<p>Thanks again,<br />
— the Jilion team</p>

<p>Next month we will reveal all the details and commercial plan of our upcoming SublimeVideo solution. We hope you will love it as much as we do. Frankly, we are super-excited about it!</p>
<p>Once again, thank you so much for your great support and patience. By the way, we promise to communicate more frequently about our progress.</p>

    <p><img style="float: left;margin: 0 24px 0 0" src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2010/04/flash.png" alt="Flash Icon" /> SublimeVideo has a broader goal than just showcasing some nice HTML5 features in a controlled environment like our <a href="http://jilion.com/sublime/video">demo page</a>. We aim at delivering a modern and simple video-embedding solution for web developers that provides the same user experience and uniform UI across browsers.</p>
<p>The first main news of the day is we have just completed the development of the Flash mode of our SublimeVideo player.  It is not a separate product, but a necessary component to achieve our ambition to offer you a truly <strong>universal video player</strong> that works in all browsers.</p>
<p>With SublimeVideo Flash mode, our users will have the warranty that their videos will play seamlessly even in non-HTML5 browsers such as IE 6, 7 or 8 and also in Firefox/Opera when the Ogg Theora video version is not available.</p>
<p><img class="no_rounded" src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2010/04/sublimevideo_and_flash.png" alt="SublimeVideo and Flash" /><br />
<em class="caption">Flash and HTML5 versions look and feel the same</em></p>
<p>To see the new Flash player in action, we created an additional <a href="http://jilion.com/sublime/video/flash">demo page where SublimeVideo Flash mode is forced</a> for all browsers (including browsers that fully support HTML5 video).</p>
<p>Here are the features of SublimeVideo Flash mode:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Same sleek UI as the HTML5 player</li>
	<li>Full-window mode (click on the full-window button, or double-click on the video) with draggable controls pane</li>
	<li>Full-screen mode (hold down Command (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows/Linux) while entering full-window mode)</li>
	<li>While in full-window or full-screen mode, press spacebar to play/pause and Esc to exit full-window/full-screen</li>
	<li>SublimeVideo automatically falls back to Flash in Firefox and Opera to decode H.264 video in case the Ogg Theora version is not provided</li>
</ul>
<p>Open web standard &#8220;purists&#8221; who do not care about compatibility with old browsers will be able to completely disable the Flash fallback to provide a pure HTML5 video experience.</p>
<p>The second big news of the day is that we have entirely rewritten our JavaScript code to remove all dependencies to external libraries or frameworks (originally SublimeVideo was written using the Prototype JS framework). This is a big deal, because it means SublimeVideo is now a standalone pure JavaScript library with the benefit that anyone can easily use it along side any version of any other libraries (jQuery, Prototype, MooTools, Dojo, <span class="caps">YUI</span>, Ext JS, &#8230;) without having to worry about conflicts.</p>
<p>Finally, we received a lot of requests concerning the release date. We really want to make this product right. The fact that you see SublimeVideo working on our demo page doesn&#8217;t mean it is fully ready to be released and embedded in any webpage out there. There&#8217;s still some work to do. Thank you for your patience, we are doing our best in order the wait will be worth it!</p>

    <p>We are working hard on the release of SublimeVideo (no date yet).</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2010/02/firefox.png" alt="Firefox Icon" style="float:left;margin:0 24px 0 0;" /> We&#8217;ve just finished adding support for Firefox and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora">Ogg Theora</a> videos. We figured we&#8217;d update the <a href="http://jilion.com/sublime/video">demo page</a> to show it to you.</p>
<p>It should work on Firefox 3.5, but we strongly encourage you to upgrade to the latest version (currently 3.6).</p>
<p>SublimeVideo on Firefox has pretty much all the basic features of the WebKit (Safari/Chrome) version, however there&#8217;re some secondary features which couldn&#8217;t be implemented because of Firefox limitations.</p>
<p>Here are the features that are currently <strong>missing</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Sleek Zoom-in/out transitions when entering/leaving full-window mode<br />
2. Playback speed controls (when in full-window mode)<br />
3. Other minor fade-in/out effects to highlight the poster frame and reveal the controls when mouse-hovering over the video</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2010/02/SublimeVideo-full-window-controls-browsers-comparison.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo Full-Window Controls Browsers Comparison" /><em class="caption">SublimeVideo full-window controls browsers comparison</em></p>
<p>We are confident that the <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/">next release of Firefox</a> (3.7) will include all the necessary improvements that will allow us to implement the missing features.</p>
<p>A note regarding true <em>full-screen</em> mode:<br />
At the moment we couldn&#8217;t integrate this directly into our controls as we did for the WebKit Nightly build (by alt-clicking the full-window button), but if you&#8217;re using Firefox 3.6 you can enter this mode by right-clicking on the video and choosing &#8220;Full Screen&#8221; from the contextual menu.</p>
<p><a href="http://jilion.com/sublime/video">Enjoy</a>.</p>

    <p>Today we&#8217;d like to show you a pre-release demo of SublimeVideo. It&#8217;s an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html5">HTML5</a> video player that will allow you to easily embed videos in any page, blog or site using the latest modern web standards.</p>
<p><a href="http://jilion.com/sublime/video"><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2010/01/sublime_video-600x480.png" alt="Sublime Video" class="no_rounded" /></a></p>
<p>Browsers makers are still working on fully supporting the HTML5 video specification, so at the moment SublimeVideo is still in <em>experimental state</em> and only works on a limited number of browsers. But the long term goal is to make it work on all modern browsers.</p>
<p>SublimeVideo will be soon released for free (at least for non-commercial use).</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Full-window mode</strong><br />
  This will maximize the video to fit the browser&#8217;s window. It can be handy if you still want to access other applications while watching a maximized video in your browser.<br />
  Besides, browsers makers are still working on implementing true fullscreen for HTML5 videos; so full-window is currently the only way to maximize the video on Safari and Chrome.</li>
	<li><strong>Full-screen mode</strong><br />
  Currently only supported in the latest <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org/">WebKit Nightly Builds</a>, you can activate this mode by <span class="caps">ALT</span>-clicking on the full-window button.</li>
	<li><strong>HTML5 video benefits</strong><br />
  No browser plugin, no Flash dependencies!<br />
  You can also jump anywhere in the video without having to wait for it to buffer.</li>
</ul>
