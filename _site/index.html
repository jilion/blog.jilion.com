Yaniv Fridman &#8211; <a href="http://www.yanivfridman.com">http://www.yanivfridman.com</a></p>
<p>Yaniv Fridman is a freelance director and motion graphic designer from Mexico City, currently working for companies in Vancouver, Toronto and Los Angeles. He mainly works remotely, and depends on his online portfolio to reach both current and future clients. Yaniv built his site purely to showcase his video and motion graphics work, all of which is served up by SublimeVideo Player.</p>
<blockquote><p><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2011/05/yaniv_fridman.jpg" alt="Matt Wigham - Big Cartel" class="no_rounded" style="float:left;margin:7px 22px 0 0" /> “Being a motion designer my knowledge building websites is limited so I needed to find a solution that was easy enough to implement it myself without compromising on the design of functionality. I did some research and tested most of today&#8217;s HTML5 players and Sublime was by far the sexiest looking and easiest to implement.</p> <p>The Sublime team was extremely helpful and fast answering my questions and solving the issues I had along the way. SublimeVideo player gave me an option to build an HTML5 site without using a portfolio template that now works on all platforms and devices. I definitely recommend it to any creative person looking for a video player that meets todays standards with a clean and elegant design.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Big Cartel provides artists with a simple, easy-to-use and customizable store to sell their stuff online. Its easy setup and customization has made Big Cartel the first choice for many artists looking to sell their clothing, music, jewelry and other products online, and has given birth to many creative and successful independent stores. Big Cartel integrated SublimeVideo Player into their site&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.bigcartel.com/post/4661048740/how-we-made-the-titanium-image">blog</a> and <a href="http://help.bigcartel.com/articles/42-google-analytics">help</a> pages, as well as throughout their &#8216;buzz&#8217; <a href="http://bigcartel.com/buzz">page</a> to showcase videos profiling some of their favorite stores. If you have ever thought about selling your stuff online, make sure to check out Big Cartel.</p>

Not only does it look amazing, it also works everywhere we need it to, from desktop to mobile. Plus, with its flexible JavaScript <span class="caps">API</span>, we&#8217;re able to wire it up with our internal stats tracking and keep tabs on every video it plays. It feels like it was made just for us.&#8221;</p>

Method &amp; Craft &#8211; <a href="http://methodandcraft.com">http://methodandcraft.com</a></p>
<p>Launched in February 2011, Method &amp; Craft boasts a rich collection of articles, interviews, notes and videos focusing on the process of design and those who practice it. The team behind Method &amp; Craft have done a great job at designing a beautiful site that also makes it easy to find and read any of their articles, interviews and notes on design. Presenting their rapidly growing collection of videos as beautifully as their text-based content was a different challenge, and we are thrilled that they turned to SublimeVideo Player to achieve just that. If you are a designer or creative of any kind who hasn’t already done so, we’d strongly recommend checking out Method &amp; Craft.</p>

The SublimeVideo player not only delivered on that need in spades, but also looks absolutely gorgeous which is a big deal to design nerds like us.&#8221;</p>

Back in early 2010 more than a million visitors enjoyed what many considered was the best HTML5 video player on the Internet.</p>
<p>A few months later, we decided to turn <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo</a> from a tech demo into the world’s best HTML5 video player solution. We began developing an ambitious cloud-based service, allowing our customers to ensure that their video will always play flawlessly on a huge variety of browsers and mobile devices, without any extra work from them, ever.</p>
<p>6 months ago we began beta-testing SublimeVideo Player &#8211; the world&#8217;s first cloud-based HTML5 video player. This was an incredibly valuable and important period for us; it not only showed us that SublimeVideo worked and scaled flawlessly, but also allowed us to show the world the value of a universal video player service.</p>
<p>Today we are commercially launching <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo</a> &#8211; making it available to everyone.<br />
Check out our <a href="http://jilion.com/pr/2011-03-30">Press Release</a> and <a href="http://sublimevideo.net/plans">Plans &amp; Pricing</a> page to find out more and <a href="https://my.sublimevideo.net/signup">sign up today</a> if you are not already a beta tester.</p>
<p>Figuring out the right pricing model for SublimeVideo was more difficult than we had initially expected, and is something that we took great care with. The valuable data we gained from our pricing survey provided us with what we needed to finalize our commercialization plans. We would like to thank the 2,000 people who participated in this survey, and all of you who gave us amazing feedback and encouragement throughout the beta period.</p>
<p>Something that the survey results confirmed for us is that we must continue to strive for the highest possible quality product and service. As such, we decided that all plans will only be differentiated by their volume levels and not their feature sets. For example, you won&#8217;t need to purchase the biggest plan in order to access <span class="caps">SSL</span>.</p>
<p>Another element we are proud to include in all plans is Peak Insurance; a flexible feature that allows your site to exceed its video pageview limit for a certain number of days in the event of a burst of traffic, without forcing you to upgrade plans.</p>
<p>We believe that features like these display our commitment to providing customers with a top-quality service.</p>
<p>We have seen some truly fantastic implementations of SublimeVideo Player from beta users, and hope that new users will also enjoy using the superior HTML5 and universal playback of SublimeVideo to showcase their own video on thousands of new sites.</p>

    <p>If you are a developer or a curious user, you have probably found yourself often <strong>right-clicking</strong> on videos in your browser to get the contextual menu and see if they are played using Flash or HTML5.</p>
<p>Today we want to show something that you have probably <strong>never seen on the Web before</strong>: a handcrafted contextual menu that consistently works<sup><a href="#fn-2011-01-19">1</a></sup> over <span class="caps">HTML</span> and Flash and that not only shows you if the video is being played with HTML5 or Flash, but also allows you to easily switch between the two modes.</p>
<p><img style="float: left;margin: 10px 25px 0 0" src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2011/01/sublimevideo_contextual_menu_animation.gif" alt="SublimeVideo Player Mode Switching" /> We think this is a great way to highlight the universal aspect of <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">our player</a> as well as the uniform implementation of both our HTML5 and Flash modes. It is also a way to show our brand without interfering with the player interface.</p>

<p>It may feel odd to see this cute contextual menu when right-clicking on a Flash video ;-). If you need some proof it is really Flash or need to access the standard contextual menu, you can hold down Command (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows/Linux) while right-clicking (this trick also works in HTML5 mode and if you are developer we know you will love it).</p>
<p>To our beta users: we will release the contextual menu publicly in a few hours. We will <a href="http://twitter.com/jilion">notify you</a> and update our <a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net/releases">Release Notes</a> page when it&#8217;s ready!</p>

    <p><a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo</a> Beta has started 3 months ago and we are extremely happy to report that basically everything is running great!</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net/releases"><img src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2010/12/SublimeVideo-Release-Notes-Screenshot.jpg" alt="SublimeVideo Release Notes Screenshot" /></a></p>
<p>Here are some information we would like to share with you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Since the Beta started, we have released 36 automatic and transparent updates of the Player to all our users, again, automatically and without bothering them. It means we updated the player in average every 3 days. You can now follow SublimeVideo player updates on our new <a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net/releases">Release Notes</a> page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>These updates were made possible thanks to the rich feedback received from our Beta testers: over 400 feedback and bug reports have been received and 98% of them answered.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>On the server side, our cloud-based infrastructure has been running smoothly from day one without any delivery interruption of the player by our <span class="caps">CDN</span> (100% uptime). Also, even if this is less visible, it is worth noting that our SublimeVideo Ruby on Rails application running on Heroku has scaled as expected along with the growth in usage, allowing us to parse large amount of data, something that will allow us to bring you really cool new features and services in the future.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>On the usage side, we wished to somehow keep a low profile during the Beta, but we are thrilled to report there are currently thousands of beta users and that the traffic is already in the range of millions of video pages served per month!</li>
</ul>
<p>At this stage of the Beta, we have now passed two important milestones:<br />
First, the Beta has confirmed the technical service is working well and will be able to scale as we enter the commercial phase.<br />
Second and maybe even more importantly, the Beta is demonstrating the value of our &#8220;SublimeVideo Universal Web Video Player as a Service&#8221; which is indeed delivering all the key benefits we expected when we announced it back in August.</p>
<p>So, you are not going to be surprised to hear we are excited!</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:15px">What&#8217;s next</h3>
<p>We are finalizing the development of the commercial release, which is scheduled for Q1 2011.</p>
<p>The pricing survey we discussed earlier will be sent out to our Beta users in January. Stay tuned, we know lots of you are waiting to know how much it will cost to start using SublimeVideo. We will do our best to please you.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we wish you all happy holidays and lots of good vibes for the new year! Thank you again for your support, it&#8217;s been an amazing year.</p>

    <p>We are happy to announce we are launching SublimeVideo Beta today and we are sending out the first wave of invitations right now.</p>
<p>A lot of you registered for the beta. We are thrilled to see the amount of requests we received and are receiving daily. If everything goes smoothly with SublimeVideo service infrastructure we will send Beta invitations to all of those who registered as quickly as possible. If you didn’t register yet, you can do it from this <a href="http://sublimevideo.net/notify">page</a>.</p>
<p>In your invitation you will be asked to create an account on <a href="https://my.sublimevideo.net">my.sublimevideo.net</a> where you will be able to generate and manage SublimeVideo players for your sites.</p>
<p><img style="position:relative;left:-5px" src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2010/09/mysublimevideo_screenshot.png" alt="MySublimeVideo Screenshot" /></p>
<p>We hope you will enjoy the super-simple process we designed for you to get your players up and running almost instantly on your sites.</p>
<p>Keep in mind SublimeVideo Player is a player, not a video hosting solution forcing you to use our service to host your videos: You retain the full flexibility to host your videos wherever you want.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.sublimevideo.net">Documentation</a> to learn more about it.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:15px">Your feedback</h3>
<p>As written earlier, SublimeVideo will be free during the Beta phase. The two main goals of this phase will be to get your feedback on the product and shape the right pricing with your help.</p>
<p>We are really looking forward to receiving your feedback!  <br />
We would love to know if you&#8217;re happy with SublimeVideo and what we can do to improve it. Please send us comments, bug reports, feature requests and suggestions for improvement using the dedicated <a href="http://my.sublimevideo.net/feedback">form</a> on MySublimeVideo.</p>

    <p><img style="float: left;margin: 5px 25px 0 0" src="http://blog.medias.jilion.com/uploads/2010/08/sublimevideo_cloud.png" alt="Introducing SublimeVideo Player as a Service" /> This is a big day for us at Jilion!<br />
Today, as promised we let you know what we’ve been working on during the past few months. We hope you’ll like it as much as we do.</p>
<p>After 6 months of exciting work, we are extremely happy to introduce <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">SublimeVideo.net</a>, our HTML5 Video Player as a Service.</p>
<p>Some of you were anticipating that we would distribute SublimeVideo as a <span class="caps">ZIP</span> file download.<br />
Well, today we’re offering a much better option &#8211; a real-world and practical HTML5 video player solution.</p>
<p>Our goal is simple: We really want you to get “state-of-the-art you can actually use”, instantly, easily and inexpensively.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, for 99% of our potential customers, HTML5 Video could be a real pain to deploy. Why? Because every browser has its own specificities which means you need to hire experts in HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3 to ensure your HTML5 Video Player works flawlessly in all of them. And that’s not all: To be sure your player does not break and that you always provide the best experience to your audience, you still need to maintain it continuously by following on a daily basis the evolution of numerous browsers and their versions, on various desktop and mobile platforms.<br />
This is just not realistic for the vast majority of web sites willing to enable HTML5 video.</p>
<p>Thanks to SublimeVideo HTML5 Video Player as a Service, none of this is a problem for you anymore: We take care of all that complexity, allowing you to instantly deliver to your audience the best HTML5 video experience possible on the web, worry-free!<br />
That&#8217;s the main benefit of SublimeVideo but there’s more:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Get your own SublimeVideo player up-and-running in seconds.</li>
	<li>Get your SublimeVideo player delivered to your audience globally through our fast, reliable and low-latency Content Delivery Network.</li>
	<li>Welcome to Zero Maintenance: Your SublimeVideo player is always up-to-date.</li>
	<li>Updates including bug-fixes and new platforms support are automatically deployed.</li>
	<li>Updates are near-instantaneous for our global customers base.</li>
	<li>Monitor your players usages in near real-time.</li>
	<li>Integration in your web pages is done in just one-simple-line of embed code that we generate for you.</li>
	<li>Integration can be done by mere mortals, i.e. non-developers.</li>
	<li>There are no integration costs, no deployment costs and no maintenance costs, the usual hidden costs of &#8220;free download solutions&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what&#8217;s next?<br />
What about the pricing and when can you start using SublimeVideo?</p>
<p>First of all, we would like to thank you for all the amazing feedback you sent us in the past few days since we opened our &#8220;Notify-Me&#8221; form on <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">sublimevideo.net</a>.<br />
After just two tweets, in the first days of a quiet August month, we received thousands of participation requests for our upcoming Beta!</p>
<p>In the next few days, we will start sending the first invitations for the Beta to as many people as possible.<br />
The Beta will be free while it&#8217;s on.<br />
During the Beta, we will fine-tune the service, collect your comments, and most importantly, we will work hard to define the best pricing model!</p>
<p>Shaping the right pricing model is going to be a challenging experience for us. We will need your help because we want to do our best to shape a pricing model that can fit a wide range of potential customers, from individuals to large companies.<br />
To address this pricing challenge, we plan to ask Beta testers to answer a quick survey and we will also contact some of you directly. We hope we can collectively find a solid answer to the question &#8220;What would you be willing to pay for the value SublimeVideo provides to you?&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the mean time, please have a look at our just released <a href="http://sublimevideo.net">sublimevideo.net</a> homepage, as well as our new <a href="http://sublimevideo.net/demo">demo page</a>!</p>
<p>Thanks again,<br />
